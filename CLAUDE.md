# The Reality Manual

## Project Instructions for Claude Code

---

## 1. Project Overview

The Reality Manual is a premium physical book sold directly through:

https://realitymanual.com

The website (which you are to help build and maintain) is a custom single-product ecommerce site for selling and fulfilling the book.

### Product

**The Reality Manual, First Edition Premium Hardcover**

The product is a premium linen hardcover with a dust jacket.

Retail price:

**$59 USD**

Currency:

**USD**

Taxes:

**No taxes are currently being added.**

The website is intentionally simple and focuses on one objective:

**Sell the book, collect payment, submit the order to BookVault for fulfillment, and confirm the order to the customer.**

**Cost/pricing note (confirmed 2026-09-08):** fulfillment provider switched
from Lulu to **BookVault**. Print cost is approximately £20 / $29 USD per
unit. Retail price is $59 USD + server-calculated shipping. Harvey has
already uploaded print-ready files directly through BookVault's own
interface (not yet via API) and a physical proof copy is on the way,
expected within a few days.

---

# 2. Your Role

You are the lead engineer responsible for building, maintaining, debugging, and improving the Reality Manual website and its supporting backend infrastructure.

Your responsibilities include:

- Frontend development
- Backend development
- Database design
- Stripe integration
- BookVault integration
- Order processing
- Shipping calculation
- First-party analytics
- SEO
- Admin functionality
- Error handling
- Testing
- Deployment
- Documentation
- Ongoing maintenance

Before making significant changes:

1. Inspect the existing implementation.
2. Understand how the relevant components work.
3. Determine how the proposed change affects the rest of the system.
4. Make the smallest clean change that solves the problem.
5. Test the change.
6. Update documentation when appropriate.

Do not unnecessarily rewrite working systems.

Do not introduce dependencies or architectural complexity without a clear reason.

Prefer simple, maintainable solutions.

You may however update this file whenever you see fit as we progress through the project so it stays up-to-date.

---

# 3. Core Product

There is one product:

**The Reality Manual**

Edition:

**First Edition Premium Hardcover**

Physical format:

**Premium linen hardcover with dust jacket**

Price:

**$59 USD**

Currency:

**USD**

Taxes:

**None at this stage**

There are no additional products or product tiers.

---

# 4. Website

The public website is:

**https://realitymanual.com**

The website (which you are to build and maintain) consists of three primary public pages:

1. Landing / Sales Page
2. Checkout Page
3. Confirmation Page

There is also a lightweight Admin Dashboard which will have SEO settings and also an analytics dashboard.

---

# 5. Core Customer Flow

The core customer journey is:


Landing Page
      ↓
Checkout
      ↓
Customer enters shipping information
      ↓
Country selected
      ↓
Shipping calculated
      ↓
Total displayed
      ↓
Stripe Elements
      ↓
Payment succeeds
      ↓
Confirmation Page
      ↓
"We're placing your order, please wait..."
      ↓
Order submitted to BookVault
      ↓
BookVault confirms successful order submission
      ↓
Confirmation Page updates
      ↓
"Your order is confirmed."


The customer should receive a clear and definitive success message only after our backend has confirmed that BookVault successfully accepted the order.

---

# 6. Technology Philosophy

The project should use a lightweight architecture.

Avoid unnecessary complexity.

This is a single-product ecommerce website, not a large ecommerce platform.

Prefer:

- Simple frontend
- Lightweight backend
- PostgreSQL or SQLlite or whatever u prefer
- Stripe
- BookVault API
- First-party analytics
- Small admin dashboard

Avoid unnecessary:

- SaaS services
- CMS platforms
- third-party analytics platforms
- complex frontend frameworks
- microservices
- unnecessary queues
- complicated authentication systems
- unnecessary abstractions

Choose technologies based on reliability, simplicity, maintainability, and ease of deployment.

---

# 7. Frontend

The public frontend should use standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript unless there is a compelling reason to use another technology.

The public site must be:

- Lightning Fast
- Mobile Responsive
- Accessible
- SEO-friendly
- Lightweight
- Visually polished
- Easy to maintain

Do not introduce a frontend framework simply for the sake of using one.

---

# 8. Backend

Use a lightweight backend application running on a VPS.

I already have a Hostinger VPS with Ngix on it. So we can use this for processing webhooks etc and the database for analytics etc.

The backend is responsible for:

- Stripe integration
- Stripe webhooks
- BookVault integration
- Order creation
- Order status
- Shipping calculation
- Database access
- Analytics ingestion
- Analytics reporting
- SEO settings
- Site settings
- Admin functionality
- Error logging
- Refund processing

The exact backend framework can be selected based on what is most appropriate for the project.

The backend must be authoritative for all important business logic.

I'll leave the management of the VPS up to you, but basically we're running the front-end on Cloudflare pages and then we have a VPS we can use also as the "brain".

---

# 9. Database

Use PostgreSQL or SQLite i'll leave this up to you. It needs to be free.

The database should contain at least the following logical areas:

- Orders
- Analytics events: pageviews on each stage of the funnel, conversions, etc.
- Shipping rates
- Site settings
- SEO settings
- Error logs

Use appropriate indexes and constraints.

Use database transactions where appropriate.

Use parameterized queries or safe ORM/database abstractions.

---

# 10. Domain

Public website:

`realitymanual.com`

The backend/API may use a suitable subdomain such as:

`api.realitymanual.com`

The exact VPS hostname, IP, deployment platform, and infrastructure should remain configurable.

Do not hardcode deployment-specific values.

I have another company installed at n8n.tattoogrowth.co on that VPS (it's my n8n server for a separate business), but i wanna use the same server for Reality Manual stuff too.

**Infrastructure note (confirmed 2026-08-15):** the actual frontend hosting
is **GitHub Pages** (via `.github/workflows/static.yml`, publishing the
`/frontend` directory on every push to `main`), with Cloudflare sitting in
front purely as a DNS/CDN proxy — not the separate "Cloudflare Pages"
hosting product. Don't remove or replace `static.yml` without checking with
Harvey first; a prior session deleted it assuming Cloudflare Pages was the
real host, which broke the live site.

---

# 11. Landing / Sales Page

Route:

`/`

The landing page is the primary sales page.

Its purpose is to:

- Present The Reality Manual
- Communicate the value of the book
- Present the physical product
- Establish the visual identity
- Encourage the visitor to purchase

The primary CTA should lead to:

`/checkout`

The page should clearly communicate:

- The Reality Manual
- First Edition Premium Hardcover
- $59 USD
- Relevant product information
- Clear purchase CTA

Final marketing copy and imagery may be supplied separately, use placeholders for VSL and or images initially.

The page structure should make it easy to replace or refine copy and assets without rebuilding the entire application.

---

# 12. Public Design Direction

The website should feel like an extension of the physical book.

The visual language should be:

- Elegant
- Minimal
- Literary
- Premium
- Luxury
- Editorial
- Archival
- Esoteric/slightly occultish/ancient manuscript-ish
- Restrained

Use a visual system based around:

- Warm ivory
- Dark text
- Elegant serif typography
- Generous whitespace
- Subtle borders
- Restrained ornamentation
- Sophisticated typography
- High-quality book imagery

The website should feel like a premium literary object.

Avoid:

- Generic Shopify aesthetics
- Generic SaaS aesthetics
- Bright modern startup colors
- Excessive gradients
- Excessive rounded cards
- Excessive animations
- Cluttered interfaces
- Overly complicated navigation
- Unnecessary visual effects

The physical book should remain the visual centerpiece.

---

# 13. Checkout Page

Route:

`/checkout`

The checkout must use Stripe Elements.

Do not redirect the customer to Stripe's generic hosted checkout.

The checkout should visually belong to the Reality Manual website.

Display:

**The Reality Manual**

**First Edition Premium Hardcover**

**$59.00 USD**

The customer must provide all information required for BookVault fulfillment.

Use BookVault's current official API documentation as the source of truth for required shipping fields.

Expected fields include:

- Full name
- Email
- Phone number
- Country
- Street address
- City
- State/province/region where applicable
- Postal/ZIP code

The exact required fields should be confirmed against the current BookVault API documentation before implementation.

---

# 14. BookVault Address Constraints

BookVault likely has character limits on certain fulfillment address fields, similar to other print-on-demand APIs. Do not assume Lulu's old limits carry over — check BookVault's official documentation and make sure whatever someone enters into our form will be accepted when we place the order via the BookVault API.

The implementation must validate these limits.

Pay particular attention to BookVault's documented limits for fields such as:

- First name
- Last name
- Organization
- Street 1
- Street 2

Validate these restrictions:

1. On the frontend for good UX.
2. On the backend for correctness and security.

Do not silently truncate customer information.

If a field is too long, display a useful validation message and allow the customer to correct it.

Do not invent character limits.

Verify the current limits against BookVault's official documentation.

Country codes must use the format expected by BookVault.

Do not use incorrect country-code assumptions.

Phone number should be collected because BookVault fulfillment requires it.

---

# 15. Shipping

Shipping is calculated by our own backend.

The customer selects their country.

The backend determines the shipping cost.

The browser must never be trusted to determine the shipping price.

The browser may send a country selection, but the server must determine the corresponding shipping rate.

The final order total is:


$59.00 book price
+
server-side shipping price
=
final total


No taxes are currently added.

---

# 16. Initial Shipping Countries

Maintain explicit shipping rates for the following countries:

1. United States
2. Canada
3. United Kingdom
4. Australia
5. Germany
6. France
7. Netherlands
8. New Zealand
9. Ireland
10. Switzerland
11. Sweden
12. Norway
13. Denmark
14. Singapore
15. Japan

Also support:

**Rest of World**

The actual shipping prices will be manually supplied based on BookVault's current shipping rates.

Do not invent these rates.

---

# 17. Shipping Configuration

Create a clear configuration/database structure for the shipping rates.

Initial placeholders:

```text
US = PLACEHOLDER
CA = PLACEHOLDER
GB = PLACEHOLDER
AU = PLACEHOLDER
DE = PLACEHOLDER
FR = PLACEHOLDER
NL = PLACEHOLDER
NZ = PLACEHOLDER
IE = PLACEHOLDER
CH = PLACEHOLDER
SE = PLACEHOLDER
NO = PLACEHOLDER
DK = PLACEHOLDER
SG = PLACEHOLDER
JP = PLACEHOLDER
REST_OF_WORLD = PLACEHOLDER
```
*I will grab these values myself and update this file when done so.
The actual values will be supplied later.

Shipping rates should be editable through the Admin Dashboard.

So after they input their country, the checkout should dynamically display:

```text
The Reality Manual      $59.00
Shipping                $XX.XX
Total                   $XX.XX
```

The server must calculate the authoritative total.

---

# 18. Stripe

Use Stripe Elements.

Use Stripe PaymentIntents.

The backend creates the PaymentIntent.

The backend calculates the authoritative final amount.

The browser must never be trusted to determine:

- Product price
- Shipping price
- Total price

The backend must calculate:

```text
book price + shipping price = total
```

The resulting total is used to create the PaymentIntent.

Use Stripe metadata to associate payments with internal orders.

At minimum, associate:

- Internal order ID
- Product identifier
- Country

---

# 19. Stripe Credentials

Use environment variables.

Required configuration should include:

```text
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

Never expose:

`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`

to the frontend.

Never expose:

`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

to the frontend.

Development must use Stripe Test Mode.

Do not use production credentials during development.

Let me know where you want these Stripe credentials and I'll supply you with everything you need.

---

# 20. Stripe Webhooks

Use Stripe's official webhook mechanism to confirm successful payments.

Verify Stripe webhook signatures.

Do not trust a frontend-only payment success message.

A payment should only be considered successfully received after the backend has verified the Stripe event.

Stripe webhooks may be delivered multiple times.

Webhook processing must therefore be idempotent.

---

# 21. Orders

Every order should have a unique internal order ID.

At minimum, store:

```text
id
stripe_payment_intent_id
stripe_payment_status
customer_name
email
phone
country
street1
street2
city
state
postal_code
book_price
shipping_price
total_price
currency
bookvault_order_id
order_status
created_at
updated_at
```

Do not store:

- Card numbers
- CVC
- Full payment credentials
- Raw sensitive payment information

Stripe should remain responsible for payment-card information.

---

# 22. Order Status

Keep the order state simple.

Recommended states:

```text
PAYMENT_PENDING
PAYMENT_RECEIVED
BOOKVAULT_PENDING
COMPLETE
FAILED
REFUNDED
```
Up to you to determine this tbh.

Do not create an unnecessarily complex fulfillment state machine.

We do not need to continuously mirror BookVault's entire downstream printing and shipping lifecycle.

Once BookVault confirms successful submission of the order, the order is considered complete from the website's perspective.

Store the BookVault order ID.

---

# 23. Customer Confirmation Flow

After Stripe confirms payment:

1. Record the order.
2. Send the order to BookVault.
3. Show the customer the confirmation page.
4. Keep the page in a waiting state.
5. Wait for our backend to confirm BookVault success.
6. Update the page immediately once confirmation is available.

Initial confirmation state:

```text
We're placing your order.

Please wait while we confirm your order.
```

Show a spinner/loading indicator.

Do not tell the customer the order is complete simply because Stripe payment succeeded.

The customer should remain on the confirmation page while the backend processes the BookVault submission.

---

# 24. Confirmation Page

Route:

`/confirmation`

The page should receive a safe internal order identifier.

Do not trust arbitrary customer-supplied order information.

The backend should verify the order before returning order information.

The frontend should periodically query our backend for the order status.

Example:

```text
GET /api/orders/{order_id}/status
```

The browser communicates only with our backend.

The browser does not communicate directly with BookVault.

When the backend knows that BookVault successfully accepted the order:

Update the page immediately.

Display:

**Your order is confirmed.**

Include:

- Order number
- Product name
- Confirmation message
- Delivery estimate

The delivery estimate should be configurable through the Admin Dashboard.

Do not permanently hardcode the estimate into frontend code.

---

# 25. BookVault Integration

Use BookVault's official API.

Before implementing or changing the BookVault integration, inspect the current official BookVault developer documentation.

Verify:

- Authentication
- API base URL
- Print/order job creation
- Required request fields
- Product identifier
- Shipping address schema
- Shipping method requirements
- Order response
- Order status behavior
- Current fulfillment confirmation mechanism (webhook or polling)
- Address validation requirements
- Relevant API restrictions

Do not invent BookVault endpoints.

Do not assume a webhook exists.

Do not rely on outdated examples if the current documentation differs.

The current official BookVault documentation is the source of truth.

---

# 26. BookVault Environment

**BookVault does not provide a sandbox environment** (confirmed 2026-09-08).
Development/integration testing will be done by placing a real test order
against BookVault's live API — there is no separate sandbox/test mode to
target. Treat that first real order carefully: verify address handling,
pricing, and confirmation behavior before relying on the flow for real
customers.

Use environment variables.

Required configuration should include (exact names to be confirmed against
BookVault's docs before implementation):

```text
BOOKVAULT_API_KEY
BOOKVAULT_API_BASE_URL
BOOKVAULT_PRODUCT_ID
```

The BookVault product/package identifier will be supplied later, once
confirmed against Harvey's uploaded print-ready files.

Do not invent it.

**Status (2026-09-08):** Harvey has uploaded print-ready interior/cover files
directly through BookVault's own interface and a physical proof copy is on
the way (expected within a few days). No BookVault API credentials are
configured in `backend/.env` yet. All prior Lulu configuration (client
ID/secret, POD package ID, sandbox setup) has been abandoned — Lulu is no
longer part of this project. Actual API integration work starts once Harvey
is back from a trip to Samui (leaving 2026-09-09, back roughly one week
later) and BookVault credentials/product ID are supplied.

---

# 27. BookVault Fulfillment

The desired flow is:

```text
Stripe payment succeeds
        ↓
Order recorded
        ↓
Confirmation page shows waiting state
        ↓
Backend submits order to BookVault
        ↓
BookVault confirms successful submission
        ↓
Database records BookVault confirmation
        ↓
Confirmation page becomes successful
```

The confirmation page must not show successful fulfillment until our backend has authoritative confirmation from BookVault.

Determine the most reliable current mechanism using BookVault's official documentation.

If BookVault provides an appropriate webhook/event mechanism, use it where appropriate.

If not, use the appropriate BookVault API status/query mechanism.

The website should not claim success based solely on having sent a request to BookVault.

---

# 28. BookVault Failure Handling

Keep failure handling simple.

If BookVault fails because of a temporary issue:

- Retry automatically a small number of times.
- Record each failure.
- Do not create duplicate orders.

If BookVault ultimately cannot accept the order:

1. Mark the order `FAILED`.
2. Record the error.
3. Refund the Stripe PaymentIntent.
4. Mark the order `REFUNDED`.
5. Update the confirmation page.

Customer-facing message (something like):

```text
We're sorry, but we couldn't complete your order.

Your payment has been refunded.

Please try placing your order again.
```

The customer should not need to contact support for ordinary fulfillment failures. If it fails, they're refunded and they can try again if they like.

---

# 29. Stripe Refunds

Refunds must be performed server-side.

Use Stripe's official refund API.

Refund the PaymentIntent associated with the internal order.

Do not allow the browser to arbitrarily trigger a refund.

Refund processing must be idempotent.

Never refund the same payment multiple times.

If a refund fails:

1. Record the failure.
2. Record the Stripe response/reference.
3. Flag the error in the Admin Dashboard.
4. Do not falsely tell the customer that their payment has been refunded.

---

# 30. Idempotency

Idempotency is mandatory throughout payment and fulfillment processing.

Potential duplicate events include:

- Stripe webhook delivered more than once
- Browser refreshing confirmation page
- Browser retrying a request
- Backend retrying a BookVault request
- Network timeout after BookVault accepted an order
- Refund request being repeated

Before creating a BookVault order:

- Check whether `bookvault_order_id` already exists.
- Check whether order status is already `COMPLETE`.
- Only submit if fulfillment has not already succeeded.

The same internal order must never result in multiple BookVault print jobs.

Refund processing must also be idempotent.

---

# 31. Analytics

Do not use Cloudflare Web Analytics.

Build first-party analytics directly into the website.

Analytics data should be stored in our own database.

Every public page should automatically track page views.

At minimum track:

```text
page_view
landing_page_view
purchase_cta_clicked
checkout_view
checkout_started
payment_submitted
payment_succeeded
bookvault_submission_started
bookvault_submission_succeeded
bookvault_submission_failed
order_complete
order_failed
refund_created
```
So i wanna be able to see a bit of a pipeline with how many visitors go through each stage.

Analytics must never block or interfere with:

- Page loading
- Checkout
- Payment
- Fulfillment

If an analytics request fails, the user experience should continue normally.

---

# 32. Analytics Session Tracking

Create an anonymous first-party session identifier.

Track:

- Session ID
- Timestamp
- Event name
- Page
- Referrer
- Country where appropriate
- Order ID where appropriate

Do not collect unnecessary sensitive personal information through analytics.

---

# 33. UTM Attribution

Capture UTM parameters:

```text
utm_source
utm_medium
utm_campaign
utm_term
utm_content
```

Also capture:

- Initial referrer
- Initial landing page
- Anonymous session ID

Preserve acquisition data through the funnel.

For example:

```text
Instagram
    ↓
Landing Page
    ↓
Checkout
    ↓
Purchase
```

should preserve the Instagram attribution through to the completed order.

---

# 34. Analytics Database

Create an `analytics_events` table.

Suggested fields:

```text
id
session_id
event_name
page
order_id
referrer
utm_source
utm_medium
utm_campaign
utm_term
utm_content
country
created_at
```

Create appropriate indexes.

The analytics system should support reporting for:

- Page views
- Unique visitors
- Checkout visits
- Checkout starts
- Payment attempts
- Successful payments
- Completed orders
- Refunds
- Revenue
- Average order value
- Conversion rate
- Revenue by country
- Traffic source
- Campaign performance

---

# 35. Conversion Metrics

Do not use an undefined "conversion rate."

Clearly define metrics.

Recommended:

### Landing Page Conversion Rate

```text
Completed Orders / Unique Landing Page Visitors
```

### Checkout Conversion Rate

```text
Completed Orders / Checkout Visitors
```

The Admin Dashboard should make the definitions clear.

---

# 36. Admin Dashboard

Route:

`/admin-dashboard`

The Admin Dashboard should be lightweight and functional.

It should include:

1. Overview
2. Orders
3. Analytics
4. Shipping
5. Site Settings
6. SEO Settings
7. Error Log

---

# 37. Admin Overview

Display:

- Today's page views
- Monthly page views
- Unique visitors
- Checkout visits
- Completed orders
- Refunded orders
- Conversion rate
- Revenue
- Average order value

Allow basic date/month selection.

---

# 38. Admin Orders

Display:

- Order ID
- Date
- Customer
- Email
- Country
- Book price
- Shipping price
- Total
- Stripe status
- BookVault status
- BookVault order ID
- Internal order status

Allow viewing order details.

Never display payment card information.

---

# 39. Admin Analytics

Provide useful reporting for:

- Traffic
- Funnel
- Orders
- Revenue
- Conversion
- Country
- UTM source
- UTM medium
- UTM campaign

Allow monthly analysis.

---

# 40. Admin Shipping

Provide an editable table for:

- United States
- Canada
- United Kingdom
- Australia
- Germany
- France
- Netherlands
- New Zealand
- Ireland
- Switzerland
- Sweden
- Norway
- Denmark
- Singapore
- Japan
- Rest of World

Each should have an editable USD shipping price.

The checkout must always use the server-side values.

---

# 41. Admin Site Settings

Allow editing of:

- Book price
- Currency
- Delivery estimate minimum
- Delivery estimate maximum
- Product name
- Product description

Default:

```text
Book price: $59
Currency: USD
```
**honestly not necessary as this might require updating on Stripe side anyway. If i change the price i'll just let you know.
The browser must not be allowed to override these values.

---

# 42. Admin SEO

Create a lightweight SEO editor.

This should provide basic controls similar to a very lightweight SEO plugin.

For each public page, allow editing of:

- Page title
- Meta description
- H1
- Canonical URL
- Open Graph title
- Open Graph description
- Open Graph image
- Robots directive

Pages:

```text
/
 /checkout
 /confirmation or thank-you
 Failure pages too
```

SEO configuration should be stored in the database.

---

# 43. SEO Infrastructure

Generate:

`robots.txt`

I don't want a sitemap actually *** i don't want people looking around the site.

Use appropriate:

- Canonical URLs
- Meta descriptions
- Open Graph metadata
- Structured data

Add relevant Product/Book structured data where appropriate.

---

# 44. Admin Authentication

The Admin Dashboard must not be publicly writable.

A complicated multi-user permission system is unnecessary.

Use a simple secure authentication mechanism appropriate for a single administrator.

Never store the admin password in plaintext.

Honestly the admin password can just be 'harvey' for now, no one will know the admin URL or pw anyway, and security isn't that big of a deal for this rn anyway.



---

# 45. Error Logging

Create an `error_logs` table.

Suggested fields:

```text
id
order_id
service
error_type
error_message
request_reference
attempt_number
created_at
```

Record errors from:

- Stripe
- BookVault
- Refund processing
- Database
- Critical backend operations

Never store secrets.

Never store full payment information.

Never expose internal stack traces to customers.

The Admin Dashboard should display recent errors.

---

# 46. Security

Never expose:

- Stripe secret key
- Stripe webhook secret
- BookVault credentials
- Database credentials
- Admin credentials

to the frontend.

Use environment variables.

Validate all backend inputs.

Use parameterized database queries.

**Im very relaxed regarding security for this version, don't worry about the above much tbh. just do the basics.

Validate:

- Email
- Phone
- Country
- Address
- BookVault field lengths
- Order IDs
- Payment references

Never trust the browser for:

- Product price
- Shipping price
- Total price
- Order status
- BookVault status
- Refund state

Never allow frontend code to communicate directly with BookVault.

Never allow frontend code to initiate arbitrary refunds.

Verify Stripe webhooks cryptographically.

Use HTTPS in production.

Do not log secrets.

Use appropriate rate limiting on sensitive endpoints.

---

# 47. Performance

The public site should be extremely lightweight.

Avoid unnecessary dependencies.

Avoid unnecessary JavaScript.

Optimize images.

Only load Stripe Elements where required.

Keep analytics lightweight.

Do not load third-party analytics scripts.

Prioritize fast loading on mobile.

# 49. Responsive Design

The website must work well on:

- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

Mobile checkout is particularly important.

Do not create horizontal scrolling.

Stripe Elements must work properly on mobile devices.

---

# 51. Development Environment

Development must initially use:

**Stripe Test Mode**

BookVault has no sandbox environment, so BookVault-side testing will
necessarily involve real orders against BookVault's live API (see section
26). Keep this scoped and deliberate — e.g. a single manual test order
placed by Harvey — rather than routine automated testing against BookVault's
production API.

Do not use production Stripe credentials during development.

---

# 52. Testing

Before production deployment, test the complete system.

Test:

- Landing page
- Purchase CTA
- Mobile layout
- Checkout
- Country selection
- Shipping calculation
- Server-side price calculation
- Stripe Elements
- PaymentIntent creation
- Stripe payment success
- Stripe webhook verification
- Order creation
- BookVault order submission (real test order — no sandbox available)
- BookVault confirmation
- Confirmation page
- Duplicate Stripe webhook handling
- Confirmation page refresh
- BookVault failure
- BookVault retry
- Stripe refund
- Refund failure handling
- Analytics events
- UTM attribution
- Admin dashboard
- Shipping editing
- SEO editing
- Mobile checkout
- Address validation
- BookVault character limits
- Idempotency

---

# 53. Production Readiness

Do not switch to full production traffic until a real BookVault test order
has been placed and verified end-to-end (order submission, confirmation
mechanism, address handling), and the Stripe test-mode flow has been
successfully verified.

The production transition should require explicitly changing:

- Stripe credentials
- BookVault credentials
- BookVault API base URL
- Database configuration
- Deployment configuration
- Webhook configuration

Do not automatically switch environments.

---

# 54. Documentation

Maintain a README containing:

- Project overview
- Architecture
- Installation
- Local development
- Environment variables
- Database setup
- Database migrations
- Stripe Test Mode
- BookVault integration (no sandbox — testing notes)
- Shipping configuration
- BookVault product configuration
- Deployment
- Production configuration
- Stripe webhook configuration
- Analytics
- Refund handling
- Troubleshooting

Keep documentation updated when architecture changes. Or just update this claude.md or whatever u want. however u need to keep on top of things.

---

# 58. Changes and Maintenance

When making a change:

1. Inspect relevant files.
2. Understand the existing implementation.
3. Make the smallest clean change.
4. Avoid unrelated refactoring.
5. Test the change.
6. Check for regressions.

# 60. Definition of Done

The project is complete when a customer can:

1. Visit `realitymanual.com`
2. Understand the product
3. Click the purchase CTA
4. Enter their shipping information
5. Select their country
6. See the correct shipping price
7. See the correct total
8. Pay securely through Stripe Elements
9. Reach the confirmation page
10. See that their order is being placed
11. Wait while the BookVault order is confirmed
12. Receive a successful confirmation only after BookVault confirms the order

If BookVault cannot fulfill the order:

1. The system records the failure.
2. The system retries where appropriate.
3. The payment is automatically refunded.
4. The order is marked refunded.
5. The customer is informed.
6. The customer can try again.

Meanwhile the system must:

- Record every order
- Record Stripe payment status
- Submit orders to BookVault
- Store BookVault order IDs
- Prevent duplicate fulfillment
- Handle refunds
- Log errors
- Track analytics
- Preserve UTM attribution
- Provide monthly reporting
- Allow shipping rates to be edited
- Allow SEO settings to be edited
- Remain secure
- Remain maintainable
- Be verified against a real BookVault test order before full production use

# 61. Guiding Principle

The entire application should remain focused on one simple flow:

```text
DISCOVER
   ↓
BUY
   ↓
PAY
   ↓
FULFILL
   ↓
CONFIRM
```

Build the simplest reliable system that accomplishes this.

Do not turn the project into a large ecommerce platform.

The goal is a beautiful, premium single-product website with a reliable payment and BookVault fulfillment pipeline.

**Let me know whenever you want me to jump into the VPS terminal to make any changes. Or if i can give u vps access somehow even better.
**Btw were using github desktop for all this and u have rights to push any changes automatically. for instance in the directory youre in now, if u were to create a index.html file, that would show at realitymanual.com/

# 62. Internal Control Panel (/db)

A password-gated internal control panel lives at `frontend/db/` (deployed
alongside the storefront via the same GitHub Pages workflow, so it's live
at `realitymanual.com/db/`). It is explicitly **separate from the
storefront** — do not conflate its data with the Stripe/BookVault order
pipeline or its Postgres/SQLite schema in `backend/`.

**Access:** hardcoded client-side password `ormiston` (see
`frontend/db/lib/auth.js`), persisted in `localStorage` so it stays logged
in on a given device. Deliberately not a real security boundary — Harvey's
call, matches the admin-password precedent in section 44. `robots.txt`
disallows `/db/`.

**Storage:** everything is client-side in IndexedDB (`frontend/db/lib/store.js`,
DB name `rm_content_ops`) — pieces, uploaded video blobs, ambient audio
blobs, and settings. There is **no backend for this yet**, so nothing syncs
across devices/browsers. If Harvey wants that, it needs a small dedicated
service on the VPS, kept separate from the storefront backend/database per
the original instruction below.

**Tabs (`frontend/db/app.js`):**
- **Content Ops** — the kanban board: Ideation → Outline Started → Outline
  Completed → Filmed → Edited → Uploaded → Processed (Audio) → Thumbnail
  Selected → Scheduled → Posted/Live. Drag-and-drop or the per-card stage
  dropdown to move a piece; click a card for a large modal editor
  (autosaving, paste-to-embed screenshots in notes). Each piece has a
  content type — Ultra-short (10–20s), Short (~1 min), Long-short (up to
  3 min), Longform (YT/FB) — plus a per-card platform tag. An overview
  strip shows, per content type, how many pieces are queued and how many
  days out the furthest-scheduled one is.
- **Upload Files** — drag-and-drop drop zone for already-edited (cut +
  captioned) videos. Dropping a file creates a piece at the `uploaded`
  stage; the same shared modal gains a Video section for that piece:
  video preview, transcript (manual for now — auto-transcribe is a
  visibly disabled stub until a transcription provider is wired up),
  backing-audio dropdown (from the ambient library in Settings), an
  in-browser thumbnail frame-picker (scrub the video, capture a frame to
  canvas — no API needed), the shared caption read-only, and a
  UTM-tracked link for longform pieces. Moving a video-linked piece to
  the `scheduled` stage (drag, dropdown, or the modal's stage select)
  auto-stamps `scheduledAt` based on the Settings cadence, appending
  after whatever's already queued for that content type.
- **Content Analytics / Sales Analytics / Website Analytics** — currently
  informational placeholders listing what will populate once the
  relevant APIs/backend exist (per-video view counts; Stripe/BookVault
  order and revenue reporting; the storefront pageview funnel from
  sections 31–39). No fake data — empty until real.
- **Settings** — publishing cadence per content type, the ambient audio
  library (upload/delete mp3s), the shared caption applied to every
  upload, the base URL used for longform UTM links, and API key fields
  for YouTube/Instagram/Facebook/TikTok plus a transcription provider.
  **These keys are stored in IndexedDB only and are not sent anywhere** —
  there's nothing wired up to use them yet. TikTok access hasn't been
  granted yet either; the field is there for when it is.

**Quick-add shortcut:** `frontend/db/quick-add.html` is a minimal
standalone page (same password/storage) meant to be added to a phone home
screen (`manifest.json` + `icon.svg` for the install prompt) — one big
textarea, autofocused, dictate via the OS keyboard's mic button, "Save to
Ideation" writes straight into the same IndexedDB store the main board
reads from, so a captured idea shows up in Content Ops immediately.

**Known limitation:** built and reviewed without a browser available in
that session to click through it — verified by Node syntax-checking the
JS/JSON and a careful manual read, not by loading the page. Test it for
real before relying on it, especially the login gate, drag-and-drop, and
the thumbnail picker.

## Original brief for this tool (confirmed 2026-09-08)

Harvey's intended eventual workflow, for context on where this is headed:

- Drag-and-drop upload of already-edited videos
- Automatic splicing in of background music (currently: manual pick from
  an uploaded ambient-audio library, not automatic)
- Automatic transcription of spoken content, used to help generate/inform a
  title for each piece (currently: manual transcript + manual title —
  auto-transcribe and auto-title need a transcription/LLM API key and are
  stubbed out)
- Scheduling and cross-posting to: YouTube (long-form + Shorts), TikTok,
  Instagram, Facebook (currently: scheduling/cadence logic is real and
  working; actual cross-posting to platforms is not built — no API keys
  exist yet and it needs a backend, not client-side JS, to hold them)
- Target publishing cadence: roughly one piece every 8 hours (currently:
  cadence is configurable per content type in Settings, defaulting to
  ultra-short/8h, short/1d, long-short/3d, longform/7d — Harvey's call to
  tune)

Real API integration (posting, transcription, analytics pulls) starts once
Harvey is back from Samui (left 2026-09-09, back roughly a week later) and
has API credentials to supply — see the Settings tab's API keys section for
where those go. Keep it lightweight, consistent with this project's general
philosophy of avoiding unnecessary complexity.
